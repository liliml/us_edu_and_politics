                   Over the years, there has been a significant shift in education levels across the United States. Data from 2010 to 2023 reveals a consistent increase in higher education attainment, 
                   with Associate's, Bachelor's, and Master's degrees showing an upward trend. Meanwhile, lower education levels saw a steady decline, with fewer individuals lacking a high school diploma 
                   or having only some college education without a degree. These trends suggest that access to education has improved, and more people are pursuing higher degrees, possibly 
                   influenced by economic demands and evolving job market requirements.

                   Political shifts during this period also present an interesting pattern. From 2010 to 2016, and again from 2021 onward, the country was under Democratic leadership, 
                   while the years 2017 to 2020 were marked by Republican leadership. Despite these shifts, the overall trend of increasing education levels remained consistent, except it did 
                   slow down a little. This suggests that long-term educational growth may be influenced more by societal and economic factors rather than by short-term political changes. 
                   However, policies regarding education funding, student loans, and workforce development could have played a role in shaping these trends. As education levels continue to rise, 
                   it will be important to examine how these changes impact socioeconomic mobility, workforce qualifications, and political engagement in the future.
