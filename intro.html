            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p class="indented">
                Education is a fundamental pillar of society, shaping economic opportunities and social mobility across generations. 
                In the United States, education level varies significantly depending on the state and is influenced by numerous factors, 
                including political leadership and policy changes over time. Our project seeks to explore the relationship between U.S. political 
                parties and various education levels like lower than 9th grade, high school diploma, and different college degrees. 
                By visualizing this data through an interactive map, we aim to provide insight into how different administrations may have 
                impacted educational outcomes at various levels.</p>

            <p class="indented">
                Our project is an interactive map, with a year slider and multiple tabs for each education level. 
                Users will be able to toggle between layers corresponding to less than 9th grade, no high school, high school, college no degree, 
                associate's, bachelor's, and master's or higher. The year slider will also display the president's political party. 
                The color scheme will reflect the political landscape—shades of blue for Democratic administrations and shades of red for Republican 
                administrations. The data for our project will primarily be sourced from the U.S. Census and the National Center for 
                Education Statistics, which we will process into geoJSON and JSON formats using QGIS, Mapshaper, and Excel.</p>

            <p class="indented">
                The target audience for our project includes the general public, educators, and policymakers. 
                For the public, the interactive map will serve as an educational tool to foster awareness about the strengths 
                and weaknesses of the U.S. education system. Educators, particularly those in training, can use the map to analyze 
                patterns of educational attainment and identify regions in need of policy intervention or additional support. 
                Policymakers and researchers may also find value in this project, as it provides a clear visualization of historical 
                educational trends in relation to political leadership.</p>
            
            <p class="indented">
                Inspired by projects such as Kyle Walker’s dot-density map of U.S. educational attainment and the U.S. Census Bureau’s 
                interactive educational data visualizations, our work will build upon existing methodologies while incorporating a 
                time-series component. Utilizing Mapbox, we will implement features that allow users to observe changes in 
                educational attainment over time. Our project not only seeks to highlight past trends but also aims to spark 
                discussions about the role of government policies in shaping the nation’s educational landscape.</p>
